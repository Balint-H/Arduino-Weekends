# Arduino-Weekends
Personal short projects with Arduino

Higlights:

lowMemWaveform:
	A cheap, low memory digital oscilloscope that can display 
	readings in a small display. Manipulates low level 
	registers on the chip to sacrifice resolution for 
	magnitudes larger sampling frequency.
	Instrumentation amplifier not included.
	
pong_v4:
	A two player game as an exercise in object based 
	programming. Uses oled display, and potentiometers as 
	controllers.  Increasing difficulty over time.

HRM2:
	Interfaces with electronic sthethoscope. Denoises the 
	signal, and displays heartrate on LCD screen.
	
CYOA and Code_writer:
	A choose your own adventure displayed on LCD, with 
	turning pages, handling debounced button inputs, 
	and several choices. Code_writer converts text 
	input into sourcecode for CYOA to speed up the 
	programming process.
	
velostat3:
	A piece of code I often reused when a project needed
	pressure sensing. Usually with a piece of velostat
	
MORSE_LOOPER and MORSE_SOUND:
	Encodes text into Morse code, to be outputted as blinking
	LED or beeping sound
